How to Implement a Non-isolated PI Compensator using a TL431

https://youtu.be/rPtf69XvrE4

This video explains how to implement a non-isolated PI compensator using a TL431. The frequency response of the PI compensator is obtained by LTspice simulations. The response is compared with a similar compensator implemented with a standard operational amplifier. 
The operation of the compensator is tested in a current-mode-controlled buck converter. LTspice simulations are performed to verify the correct operation of the compensator.
